BW-Lib (collectively, the BW::* module tree) is a set of perl modules
developed by Bill Weinman over the course of about 15 years. It provides
a uniform interface for a number of common functions, most of which are
available elsewhere with other interfaces.

The purpose of this library is to provide a common set of functions for
use in developing applications in Perl without having to use a lot of
different libraries with different requirements and different
interfaces. The commonality of the interfaces works for me.

Please note: This library duplicates the functionality of a number of
other common modules, so there is very little here that is unique. It's
not designed to be "better" -- only more uniform, and therefor easier to
use (at least I find it so).

I've submitted it to CPAN so that it can be easily installed for the
various applications that I distribute that use it.

See INSTALL for installation instructions.
